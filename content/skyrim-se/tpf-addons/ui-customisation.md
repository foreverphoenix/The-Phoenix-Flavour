## About the addon

- **Author:** Phoenix
- **Support:** #tpf-addon-support

This addon is a revival of one we had a long time ago. I've moved some mods from the main guide here as they may be only for a very specific taste or type of player. Please, as always, read carefully.

**Each section is optional.** You can skip whatever you don't like, or install everything.

### New Separator

- Create a new separator **UI CUSTOMISATION** in Mod Organizer 2.
- Place it right above the **GRAPHICS BASELINE** separator.
- All mods you install from this Addon go below that new separator.

> Feel free to change the colour for the new separator so it is distinct from the "official" ones.

### Paper Style

While this Addon is essentially modular, I'd recommend installing both the **Dear Diary** and the **Paper World Map** sections as well as Sovngarde Font from the **Font Replacer** section for a complete "old school" RPG paper theme overhaul.

## Additional UI Mods

All mods from this section are **optional**. You can install any or all of them, they do not conflict.

## Font Replacer

My personal choice of Roboto as a replacer for the default font has caused a decent amount of controversy so here are some alternatives. I believe that Roboto fits the modern and minimalistic UI of Skyrim and SkyUI very well but it's a matter of personal choice. If you prefer the vanilla font, you can simply disable Roboto in the mod order.

Font replacers are obviously going to overwrite each other so you can't install multiple ones. You don't need to disable Roboto in the mod order if you place a different font replacer below it.

**CHOOSE ONE.**

##### [Sovngarde - A Nordic Font](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/386?tab=files)

> You can try the other options, too, but I've never used them myself and cannot tell you how well they work or how good they look. Fertigo is a solid choice and was the go-to font replacer for many before Sovngarde was released.

## Paper World Map

This will replace the default world map with a paper version. However, it comes with some downsides: Several plugin-based mods from the original setup need to be disabled and a new patch has to be installed. This is unfortunate because it means you can't easily update the base setup (the official loadorder.txt obviously won't account for those changes). That means I recommend *not changing the profile* after installing this mod and all related files (applying no updates or installing other Addons).

- Disable **A Quality World Map** in your mod order.
- Disable **Dynamic Snow For Map (Type 1)** in your mod order.
- Disable **Dawnguard Map Markers** in your mod order.
- Disable **Luminosity - A Quality Worldmap Compatibility Patch** in your mod order (Lighting section).

##### [A Quality World Map - Paper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5804?tab=files)

#### Additional Instructions

- Unpack and delete the following BSAs:
  - `IcePenguinWorldMapPaper.bsa`

> Unpacking these files will make it so they take priority and overwrite Cathedral Landscape.

#### Load Order
