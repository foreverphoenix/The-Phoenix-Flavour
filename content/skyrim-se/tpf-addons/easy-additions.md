## About the addon

- **Author:** Phoenix
- **Support:** #tpf-addon-support

While the guide no longer includes optional mods, there are plenty of mods out there that can be added to the base TPF setup with no further steps required. On this page, I will be featuring some of them.

**Every mod is optional.**

## Font Replacer

My personal choice of Roboto as a replacer for the default font has caused a decent amount of controversy so here are some alternatives. I believe that Roboto fits the modern and minimalistic UI of Skyrim and SkyUI very well but it's a matter of personal choice. If you prefer the vanilla font, you can simply disable Roboto in the mod order.

Font replacers are obviously going to overwrite each other so you can't install multiple ones. You don't need to disable Roboto in the mod order if you place a different font replacer below it.

> You can try the other options, too, but I've never used them myself and cannot tell you how well they work or how good they look. Fertigo is a solid choice and was the go-to font replacer for many before Sovngarde was released.
