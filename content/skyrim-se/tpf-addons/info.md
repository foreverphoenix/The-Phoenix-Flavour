## About Forks and Addons

Once upon a time, The Phoenix Flavour used to be modular. It also had optional mods. The idea was to give the user choices wherever possible and mark mods that are easy to swap as such. However, over time this proved to be enormously cumbersome to maintain on our end. After removing any sort of optional mods and modularity, the overall quality of the guide (and my own motivation to work on it) sky-rocketed. Needless to say, it was the right decision and we'll never go back to the pre-3.0 structure.

That being said, I see a way to allow customisation without having to split my own attention between various possible installations. The Phoenix Flavour as the main setup will be completely unaffected by this section and any support for users of either manual guide or Wabbajack version will remain restricted to those with unedited setups. That includes Addons. **Installing Addons disqualifies you from receiving support in the TPF help channels on Discord.**

- Install The Phoenix Flavour first, manually or through Wabbajack. 
- Test your setup. Play a little. Get help for any issues you may encounter.
- Only THEN should you consider installing Addons.

If you run into issues after installing Addons, you may ask for help in the dedicated TPF Addons section on the Discord server where the authors of the various Addons provide support for their tweaks.

> You should start a new character after installing addons.

**Addons are incompatible with each other unless EXPLICITLY stated.**

### Wabbajack Users

- There is no Wabbajack version of any Addons.
- Wabbajack users are not *supposed* to install Addons.

Of course Wabbajack users can *in theory* follow the manual instructions for Addons like anyone else but I highly recommend against it. If you did not install TPF manually and have no or little prior modding experience, you are likely to make mistakes or simply miss crucial steps. It's not like I can stop you from installing Addons anyway but I'd consider it a bad idea.

## Mod Organizer Profiles

One of the best features that Mod Organizer 2 brings to the table is **profiles**. They allow you to keep different mod and load orders with specific INI settings as well as separate save files. The base **The Phoenix Flavour** profile in Mod Organizer 2 shouldn't be edited by anything other than official updates so it remains clean. Addons should be installed on a new profile.

- In Mod Organizer 2, open the **Profiles** window.
- profile name
- checkboxes

### Profile-Specific Saves

Since you **copied** the base profile, your new profile will have the same INI files (a set tweaked with BethINI earlier in the Initial Setup section) and any saves you may have created with it. If you want to remove those saves (after installing Addons, you should start a new character anyway), you can go to the **Saves** tab in the right pane of Mod Organizer and delete them there. They will ONLY be deleted in the new profile. When you return to the base TPF profile and run the game, they will still be available there.
